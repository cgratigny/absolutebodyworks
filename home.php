<p><h2>Welcome to Absolute Bodyworks...</h2></p><br><br>


<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
My Name Is Jonathan C. Primack and I am a fully Licensed<br> Massage Therapist. </p>
   <p> People often ask me how I found the World of Massage...</p><br><br>
<p><br>I simply tell them ....</p>
<p>"I didn't .....</p>
<p>It found me...." </p>
</div>

<div id='section' style='height:295px;'>
<? shadowimage ("images/2011/office.jpg","right"); ?>
<p>I was born and raised in New York and moved to Portland, OR in the late 90's. I have been enjoying the benefits of receiving Therapeutic Massage for well over ten years. After a very prestigious career in the Hospitality Industry I was looking to make a significant change in my life and decided to follow my heart and find a better way to make a difference in this world we live in. Believe me when I tell you I made the right decision. I am a solid therapist trained here in Oregon in Deep Tissue, Swedish, Thai, and Trigger Point Massage. </p><br><br>


<p>I have been in practice for over eight years and have also pursued a solid teaching career in the science and art of bodywork. You can't imagine the good fortune and fulfillment I have gotten through working with so many wonderful clients. I have a wide and varied client base. I regularly have Construction Workers, Housewives, Lawyers, Accountants, Computer Technicians, Secretaries, Students, Bartenders, and Medical Professionals all making their way into my office for some much needed Bodywork. It is often the case that I work directly with other health care professionals in matters of Injury or Accident rehabilitation in order to best help my clients get the best possible treatment in their healing process. </p>

<p>My Bodywork ...</p>
<p>My Focus ...</p>
<p>My Time ...</p>
<p>Is all about you ...  </p>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>The Office is located at 2100 NE Broadway up on the second floor in Suite 225. My Practice is part of the ASHA Wellness Center. What I tell everyone is that even though the address is designated as Broadway the building actually faces NE 21st Avenue. So the Big Orange Building sitting in between the One Way streets of NE Broadway and NE Weidler is where you will find me. There is a peaceful waiting area for you to make yourself comfortable in before our session time. I keep a very prompt schedule and will always be out to get you as close to our appointment time as possible. We have a large parking facility that is also has a nice supply of bike racks. If you are early for your appointment or need some breathing time afterward there is a beautiful central courtyard as well as a small park behind the building to spend a little time in.</p>

<? shadowimage ("images/2011/statue.jpg","right"); ?>
<br><br><p>I am in my office on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. My hours are usually pretty flexible... usually my bodywork begins at 11 am and I try not to book any appointments later then 8 pm. If you call me at 971 - 404 - 9923 I will be happy to talk with you and answer any questions you might have. If you are interested at that time we can set you up with an appointment that best meets your needs. </p>

<br><br><p>For first time clients there will be a few forms to fill out as well as a comprehensive interview before any bodywork may be performed. Please allow time to vary depending on your situation. </p>
